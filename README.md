struc-ture - a simple 2D structural analysis tool

Current features:
- solves 2D trusses composed of pin joints and tension/compression members
- input of nodes, linear members, and supports
- input of member axial rigidity
- input of nodal and distributed loads
- computes axial forces, node reactions, and node displacements
- responsive design
- touch controls

To-do:
- drawing tools
- deflected shape
- moment diagrams
